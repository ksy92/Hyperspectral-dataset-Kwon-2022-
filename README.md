# This dataset is included in a Ph.D. dissertation, titled "Development of Measurement Method of Suspended Sediment Concentration in Rivers Using UAV-based Hyperspectral Imagery " (Siyoon Kwon at Seoul National University). 
# Spectra from hyperspectral images and corresponding SSC can be obtained in this file, and they were collected in field-scale experiments in open channels and field surveys in rivers. 

# This dataset is also related to the papers below:
